      <li>But be ready to ask for help when you need it.</li>

# Lead Projects

You won't <em>always</em> be leading, but you <em>can</em>.

<div v-click class="mt-4">
Show your ability to lead in your every day tasks.
<ul class="mt-2">

# What about AI?

---

# AI is a Tool, Not a Title

I didn't talk about this yet, because AI isn't something that will make you a senior engineer.

<div v-click class="mt-4">
It's a powerful tool, but like any tool, you need to know how and when to use it.
</div>

---
layout: two-cols
---

## What AI is Good For

- Doing things _fast_
- Working through an idea
- Basic tasks
  - Github Copilot code reviews
  - Scaffolding tests
  - Resolving package issues
- Getting started on complex tasks
- Assisting in what you're working on (e.g. tab-to-complete)

::right::

<div v-click>

## What AI is Bad For

- **Communication**: Genuine connection is better than generic.
- **Getting Experience**: AI solving problems for you doesn't teach you the solutions.
- **Completing Complex Tasks**:
  - AI code can be low quality.
  - It can mix styles and best practices.
  - They're still just large language models, not developers.

</div>

---

# AI Can't Replace You

AI cannot understand your users' needs like you do.

<div v-click class="mt-4">
Between you and AI, only **you** can truly think about the person using the code that's being written, or the feature that's being built.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 text-teal-400">
AI can do exactly what you ask, and still build something that doesn't work for most people.
</div>

# A Brief History of Coding Tools

<div v-click>
<b>Notepad</b> -> Magical, simple text.
</div>
<div v-click class="mt-2">
<b>Notepad++</b> -> Syntax highlighting!
</div>
<div v-click class="mt-2">
<b>IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio)</b> -> Code completion.
</div>
<div v-click class="mt-2">
<b>Modern Editors (VS Code, etc.)</b> -> Powerful extensions, intellisense for everything.
</div>
<div v-click class="mt-8">
Code completion is a tool, it's not a replacement for reason. <em class="text-teal-400">AI is the same.</em>

# So, where do you want to be in 5 years?

# Set Goals

The most important skill you can learn is setting goals.

<ul>
  <li v-click>Goals for projects</li>
  <li v-click>Goals for sprints</li>
  <li v-click>Goals for tasks</li>
  <li v-click>Goals for yourself.</li>
</ul>

<div v-click class="mt-4">
Use frameworks like <b class="text-teal-400">SMART</b> goals.
</div>

---

# Remember You're Human

<div v-click>
You'll make mistakes.
</div>
<div v-click>
You can't do everything.
</div>
<div v-click>
You can't always control the outcome.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-2xl">
But you <em>can</em> control the direction you're going.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4">
Not meeting your goal is a valid outcome, but trying will always take you somewhere.
</div>

---

# Find Your Path

<div v-click>
Find what you want to be doing, and what you don't.
</div>
<div v-click>
Set goals to learn what you need to get there.
</div>

<ul class="mt-4">
  <li v-click>Side projects</li>
  <li v-click>Open source</li>
  <li v-click>Build a community</li>
</ul>

# Never forget the people that you're writing code for.
