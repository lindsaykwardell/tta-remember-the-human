# AI is a Tool

I didn't talk about this yet, because AI isn't something that will make you a senior engineer.

<div v-click class="mt-4">
It's a powerful tool, but like any tool, you need to know how and when to use it.

## What AI is Good For

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Doing things _fast_
  - Or at least feel fast
- Working through an idea
- Basic tasks
  - Github Copilot code reviews
  - Scaffolding tests
  - Resolving package issues
- Getting started on complex tasks
  - Like scaffolding slides
- Assisting in what you're working on (e.g. tab-to-complete)

</v-clicks>

<div v-click>

## What AI is Bad For

</div>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- **Communication**: Genuine connection is better than generic.
- **Getting Experience**: AI solving problems for you doesn't teach you the solutions.
- **Completing Complex Tasks**:
  - AI code can be low quality.
  - It can mix styles and best practices.
  - They're still just large language models, not developers.

</v-clicks>

# AI Can't Replace You

AI cannot understand your users' needs like you do.

<div v-click class="mt-4">

Between you and AI, only **you** can truly think about the person using the code that's being written, or the feature that's being built.

</div>

<h2 class="text-3xl text-center mt-8" v-click>AI can do <span class="text-purple-400">exactly what you ask</span>, and still build something that doesn't work for <span class="text-purple-400">most people</span>.</h2>

# Set Goals

The most important skill you can learn is setting goals.

<ul>

  <li v-click>Goals for sprints</li>
  <li v-click>Goals for tasks</li>
  <li v-click>Goals for yourself.</li>
</ul>

# Remember You're Human

<div v-click>
You'll make mistakes.
</div>
<div v-click>
You can't do everything.
</div>
<div v-click>
You can't always control the outcome.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-2xl">
But you <em>can</em> control the direction you're going.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4">
Not meeting your goal is a valid outcome, but trying will always take you somewhere.
